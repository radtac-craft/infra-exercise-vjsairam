# DevOps Exercise #1

* Deploy a web application to a cloud provider of your choice. This web application can be something you have written yourself or an open-source project.
* Deploy the web application as a Docker Container.
* Deploy the Docker Container using Kubernetes.
* Any supporting infrastructure should be configured and deployed as code (e.g. Terraform)
* Bonus points for any build and deployment automation employed in the deployment of the web application.
* Bonus points for demonstrating the ability to deploy, destroy and re-deploy the web application and any supporting infrastructure.
* Include all code and artefacts you create to complete this exercise within this repository for review.
